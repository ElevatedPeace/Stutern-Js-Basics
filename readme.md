6) Differentiate between statically and dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category.
A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. This means that the programmer must specify what type each variable is.
The main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.

Examples: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala

A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that the programmer can write a little quicker because he do not have to specify variable types every time.

Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang
